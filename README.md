# Jenkins ANSI Color Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dblock/jenkins-ansicolor-plugin.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dblock/jenkins-ansicolor-plugin)

This plugin adds support for standard ANSI escape sequences, including color, to Console Output.

This plugin is available [here](http://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/ansicolor/)
and has [a page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin) on the Jenkins Wiki.

## Does it Even Work?

Create a job in Jenkins that executes the following shell script. Don't forget to check the "Color the ANSI Console Output" option.

    printf "\e[31mHello World\e[0m\n"
    printf "Normal \e[1mBold\e[0m\n"
    printf "Normal \e[4mUnderlined\e[0m\n"

## Notes on the shells Zsh and Bash

If you commonly use **Zsh** as your login shell, it's important to keep in mind
that the `echo` command (shell builtin) supports character escaping.

**Bash** however, does not.

This can cause you a bit of confusion. For example, if you test your
shell scripts (which use `echo`) in Zsh, and they work fine.  Then you
try to run them as part of a job on Jenkins (which will use be using
Bash by default), it's quite possible you won't see colorized output,
instead, you only see the ANSI control codes, still embedded in your
text.

There are ways around this, however, we recommend you use the `printf`
command instead. It'll _just work_ everywhere, and allow `\e`, `\033`
or `\x1b` to be used as the escape character.

For example:

    printf "\e[31mHello\e[0m\n"
    printf "\033[31mHello\033[0m\n"
    printf "\x1b[31mHello\x1b[0m\n"

Will all print Hello in red on any system / shell that has `printf` (ie. anything POSIX compliant)

## Supported ANSI Color Codes

Only the standard [ANSI Color Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_colors) are supported for both foreground
and background colors. "High Intensity" colors in the 90-109 range are non-standard are not supported. The `colorize`
ruby library, for example, emits high intensity codes when using the "light" color options.

See [issue #16](https://github.com/dblock/jenkins-ansicolor-plugin/issues/16) for a sample of non-standard output.

## Colorizing Ruby RSpec Output

RSpec formatters detect whether RSpec is running in a terminal or not, therefore suppressing color output under Jenkins. Specify `--colour` in your `.rspec` file or options, along with the following setup in `spec_helper.rb`.

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
 config.tty = true
end
```

## Using in workflows

The build wrapper can be used to colorize the output of steps in a workflow. The example below shows how to use it.

```groovy
wrap([$class: 'AnsiColorBuildWrapper', 'colorMapName': 'XTerm', 'defaultFg': 1, 'defaultBg': 2]) {
sh 'something that outputs ansi colored stuff'
}
```
